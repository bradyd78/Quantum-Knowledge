## 2. 🧮 Linear Algebra
<a name="2-linear-algebra"></a>

Linear algebra is the mathematical backbone of quantum computing. It helps describe quantum states, gates, and measurements.

### 🔑 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Quantum Role |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Vector** | Ordered list of numbers | Represents quantum states (`|ψ⟩`) |
| **Matrix** | Grid of numbers | Represents quantum gates |
| **Inner Product** | Measures similarity | Calculates probabilities |
| **Tensor Product** | Combines vectors | Builds multi-qubit systems |
| **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors** | Special matrix properties | Describe measurements |
| **Complex Numbers** | Real + imaginary parts | Used in amplitudes |
| **Unitary/Hermitian Matrices** | Preserve norms / real eigenvalues | Define gates and observables |

## 3. 🔄 Schrödinger Equation

The **Schrödinger equation** describes how quantum states evolve over time.

### 🧮 Time-dependent form:
$$ i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(x, t) $$

- **Ψ(x, t)**: wavefunction
- **Ĥ**: Hamiltonian operator (total energy)
- **ħ**: reduced Planck’s constant

This equation is the quantum analog of Newton’s laws — it governs the dynamics of particles.


## 4. 🧃 Dirac Notation
<a name="3-dirac-notation"></a>

Dirac notation uses “kets” and “bras” to describe quantum states:

- **Ket (`|ψ⟩`)** → “Should be” — like labeling a juice box: “This is supposed to be apple juice.”
- **Bra (`⟨ψ|`)** → “Seems like” — tasting it: “Does this act like apple juice?”
- **Bra–ket (`⟨ψ|ψ⟩`)** → “I’m this sure” — measuring how likely it is apple juice.

## 6. 🧪 Quantum Mechanics Basics
<a name="5-quantum-mechanics-basics"></a>

Quantum mechanics describes the rules that govern particles at atomic and subatomic scales.

### 🧠 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Superposition** | A particle can exist in multiple states at once until measured |
| **Entanglement** | Two particles can be correlated in such a way that measuring one affects the other instantly |
| **Measurement** | Observing a quantum system collapses it into a definite state |
| **Uncertainty Principle** | You can't precisely know both position and momentum: $$ \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2} $$ |
| **Wavefunction** | A mathematical function that describes the quantum state of a system |
| **Quantization** | Energy levels are discrete, not continuous |

### 🔬 Famous Experiments

- **Double-slit experiment** – Demonstrates wave-particle duality
- **Photoelectric effect** – Shows light behaves as particles (photons)
- **Stern-Gerlach experiment** – Reveals quantum spin and measurement
- **Bell’s inequality tests** – Confirms quantum entanglement
