This repo is going to contain different resources that helped me learn quantum topics. I will also include my own personal way of explaining topics. Feel free to add or edit the content.


# Dirac Notation
📦 Dirac Notation — In Juice Box Terms
Dirac notation uses “kets” and “bras” to describe quantum states:

Ket (|ψ⟩) → “Should be” — like labeling a juice box, e.g. “This is supposed to be apple juice.”

Bra (⟨ψ|) → “Seems like” — tasting it to check, e.g. “Does this act like apple juice?”

Bra–ket (⟨ψ|ψ⟩) → “I’m this sure” — measuring how likely it actually is apple juice.

It’s a way to represent and compare quantum states using inner products. Succinctly: Ket = identity, Bra = evaluation, Bra–ket = confidence.
