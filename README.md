# Quantum Knowledge

This repo is going to contain different resources that helped me learn quantum topics. I will also include my own personal way of explaining topics. Feel free to add or edit the content.

## 1. Dirac Notation

📦 **Dirac Notation — In Juice Box Terms**

Dirac notation uses “kets” and “bras” to describe quantum states:

- **Ket (|ψ⟩)** → “Should be” — like labeling a juice box, e.g. “This is supposed to be apple juice.”
- **Bra (⟨ψ|)** → “Seems like” — tasting it to check, e.g. “Does this act like apple juice?”
- **Bra–ket (⟨ψ|ψ⟩)** → “I’m this sure” — measuring how likely it actually is apple juice.

It’s a way to represent and compare quantum states using inner products.
Succinctly: **Ket = identity, Bra = evaluation, Bra–ket = confidence.**
