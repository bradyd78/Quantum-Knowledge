## 2. 🧮 Linear Algebra
<a name="2-linear-algebra"></a>

Linear algebra is the mathematical backbone of quantum computing. It helps describe quantum states, gates, and measurements.

### 🔑 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Quantum Role |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Vector** | Ordered list of numbers | Represents quantum states (`|ψ⟩`) |
| **Matrix** | Grid of numbers | Represents quantum gates |
| **Inner Product** | Measures similarity | Calculates probabilities |
| **Tensor Product** | Combines vectors | Builds multi-qubit systems |
| **Eigenvalues/Eigenvectors** | Special matrix properties | Describe measurements |
| **Complex Numbers** | Real + imaginary parts | Used in amplitudes |
| **Unitary/Hermitian Matrices** | Preserve norms / real eigenvalues | Define gates and observables |

## 3. 🧃 Dirac Notation
<a name="3-dirac-notation"></a>

Dirac notation uses “kets” and “bras” to describe quantum states:

- **Ket (`|ψ⟩`)** → “Should be” — like labeling a juice box: “This is supposed to be apple juice.”
- **Bra (`⟨ψ|`)** → “Seems like” — tasting it: “Does this act like apple juice?”
- **Bra–ket (`⟨ψ|ψ⟩`)** → “I’m this sure” — measuring how likely it is apple juice.

## 5. 🧪 Quantum Mechanics Basics
<a name="5-quantum-mechanics-basics"></a>

Core principles of quantum mechanics:

- **Superposition**: particles exist in multiple states simultaneously
- **Entanglement**: particles share correlations across space
- **Measurement**: observing affects the system
- **Uncertainty Principle**: limits precision of simultaneous properties

_Add your own explanations and links as you learn._
